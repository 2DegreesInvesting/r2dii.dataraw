The goal of the r2dii.dataraw package is to access raw or lightly-prepared data. It allows you to access "live" data from 2dii's dropbox folder and to take a snapshot of it.

## Installation

To minimize installation errors, ensure your R environment is as follows:

* R version is recent.
* All packages are updated (run `update.packages()`; maybe use `ask = FALSE`).
* No other R session is running.
* Current R session is clean (click _Session \> Restart R_).

```r
# install.packages("devtools")

# To install from a private repo, see ?usethis::browse_github_token()
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.dataraw", auth_token = "abc")
```
